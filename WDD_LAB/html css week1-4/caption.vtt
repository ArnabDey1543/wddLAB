00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.600
If you wanna run away with
me, I know a galaxy

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.700
And I can take you for a ride

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
I had a premonition that
we fell into a rhythm

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.300
Where the music don't stop for life

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
Shining just the way I like

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
If you're feeling like you need
a little bit of company

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600
You met me at the perfect time

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.400
You want me, I want you, baby

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.800
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.100
The Milky Way, we're renegading

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

14
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.700
I got you, moonlight,
you're my starlight

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.700
I need you all night, come
on, dance with me

16

I'm levitating

17
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.000
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
(You're the moonlight)

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.000
I need you all night, come
on, dance with me

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.500
I'm levitating

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.600
I believe that you're for me,
I feel it in our energy

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.800
I see us written in the stars

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.100
We can go wherever, so let's
do it now or never

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.500
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far

24
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.100
Glitter in the sky, glitter
in our eyes

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.200
Shining just the way we are

26
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400
I feel like we're forever every
time we get together

27
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.900
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

28
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.700
You want me, I want you, baby

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.900

My love is like a rocket,
watch it blast off

48
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.000
And I'm feeling so electric,
dance my ass off

49
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.400
